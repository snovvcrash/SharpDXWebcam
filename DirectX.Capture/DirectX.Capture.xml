              This is the core class of the Capture Class Library. The following 
              sections introduce the Capture class and how to use this library.
              
             <br/><br/>
             <para><b>Basic Usage</b></para>
             
             <para>
              The Capture class only requires a video device and/or audio device
              to begin capturing. The <see cref="T:DirectX.Capture.Filters"/> class provides
              lists of the installed video and audio devices. 
             </para>
             <code><div style="background-color:whitesmoke;">
              // Remember to add a reference to DirectX.Capture.dll
              using DirectX.Capture
              ...
              Capture capture = new Capture( Filters.VideoInputDevices[0], 
                                             Filters.AudioInputDevices[0] );
              capture.Start();
              ...
              capture.Stop();
             </div></code>
             <para>
              This will capture video and audio using the first video and audio devices
              installed on the system. To capture video only, pass a null as the second
              parameter of the constructor.
             </para>
             <para> 
              The class is initialized to a valid temporary file in the Windows temp
              folder. To capture to a different file, set the 
              <see cref="P:DirectX.Capture.Capture.Filename"/> property before you begin
              capturing. Remember to add DirectX.Capture.dll to 
              your project references.
             </para>
            
             <br/>
             <para><b>Setting Common Properties</b></para>
             
             <para>
              The example below shows how to change video and audio settings. 
              Properties such as <see cref="P:DirectX.Capture.Capture.FrameRate"/> and 
              <see cref="P:DirectX.Capture.Capture.AudioSampleSize"/> allow you to programmatically adjust
              the capture. Use <see cref="P:DirectX.Capture.Capture.VideoCaps"/> and 
              <see cref="P:DirectX.Capture.Capture.AudioCaps"/> to determine valid values for these
              properties.
             </para>
             <code><div style="background-color:whitesmoke;">
              Capture capture = new Capture( Filters.VideoInputDevices[0], 
                                             Filters.AudioInputDevices[1] );
              capture.VideoCompressor = Filters.VideoCompressors[0];
              capture.AudioCompressor = Filters.AudioCompressors[0];
              capture.FrameRate = 29.997;
              capture.FrameSize = new Size( 640, 480 );
              capture.AudioSamplingRate = 44100;
              capture.AudioSampleSize = 16;
              capture.Filename = "C:\MyVideo.avi";
              capture.Start();
              ...
              capture.Stop();
             </div></code>
             <para>
              The example above also shows the use of video and audio compressors. In most 
              cases you will want to use compressors. Uncompressed video can easily
              consume over a 1GB of disk space per minute. Whenever possible, set 
              the <see cref="P:DirectX.Capture.Capture.VideoCompressor"/> and <see cref="P:DirectX.Capture.Capture.AudioCompressor"/>
              properties as early as possible. Changing them requires the internal filter
              graph to be rebuilt which often causes most of the other properties to
              be reset to default values.
             </para>
            
             <br/>
             <para><b>Listing Devices</b></para>
             
             <para>
              Use the <see cref="F:DirectX.Capture.Filters.VideoInputDevices"/> collection to list
              video capture devices installed on the system.
             </para>
             <code><div style="background-color:whitesmoke;">
              foreach ( Filter f in Filters.VideoInputDevices )
              {
            		Debug.WriteLine( f.Name );
              }
             </div></code>
             The <see cref="T:DirectX.Capture.Filters"/> class also provides collections for audio 
             capture devices, video compressors and audio compressors.
            
             <br/>
             <para><b>Preview</b></para>
             
             <para>
              Video preview is controled with the <see cref="P:DirectX.Capture.Capture.PreviewWindow"/>
              property. Setting this property to a visible control will immediately 
              begin preview. Set to null to stop the preview. 
             </para>
             <code><div style="background-color:whitesmoke;">
              // Enable preview
              capture.PreviewWindow = myPanel;
              // Disable preview
              capture.PreviewWindow = null;
             </div></code>
             <para>
              The control used must have a window handle (HWND), good controls to 
              use are the Panel or the form itself.
             </para>
             <para>
              Retrieving or changing video/audio settings such as FrameRate, 
              FrameSize, AudioSamplingRate, and AudioSampleSize will cause
              the preview window to flash. This is beacuse the preview must be
              temporarily stopped. Disable the preview if you need to access
              several properties at the same time.
             </para>
             
             <br/>
             <para><b>Property Pages</b></para>
              
             <para>
              Property pages exposed by the devices and compressors are
              available through the <see cref="P:DirectX.Capture.Capture.PropertyPages"/> 
              collection.
             </para>
             <code><div style="background-color:whitesmoke;">
              // Display the first property page
              capture.PropertyPages[0].Show();
             </div></code>
             <para>
              The property pages will often expose more settings than
              the Capture class does directly. Some examples are brightness, 
              color space, audio balance and bass boost. The disadvantage
              to using the property pages is the user's choices cannot be
              saved and later restored. The exception to this is the video
              and audio compressor property pages. Most compressors support
              the saving and restoring state, see the 
              <see cref="P:DirectX.Capture.PropertyPage.State"/> property for more information.
             </para>
             <para>
              Changes made in the property page will be reflected 
              immediately in the Capture class properties (e.g. Capture.FrameSize).
              However, the reverse is not always true. A change made directly to
              FrameSize, for example, may not be reflected in the associated
              property page. Fortunately, the filter will use requested FrameSize
              even though the property page shows otherwise.
             </para>
             
             <br/>
             <para><b>Saving and Restoring Settings</b></para>
              
             <para>
              To save the user's choice of devices and compressors, 
              save <see cref="F:DirectX.Capture.Filter.MonikerString"/> and user it later
              to recreate the Filter object.
             </para>
             <para>
              To save a user's choices from a property page use
              <see cref="P:DirectX.Capture.PropertyPage.State"/>. However, only the audio
              and video compressor property pages support this.
             </para>
             <para>
              The last items to save are the video and audio settings such
              as FrameSize and AudioSamplingRate. When restoring, remember
              to restore these properties after setting the video and audio
              compressors.

             The property page to configure a Video for Windows compliant
             compression codec. Most compressors support this property page
             rather than a DirectShow property page. Also, most compressors
             do not support the IAMVideoCompression interface so this
             property page is the only method to configure a compressor.

             This property will be null if unable to retrieve the property page's

             After showing this property page, read and store the value of 
             this property. At a later time, the user's choices can be 
             reloaded by setting this property with the value stored earlier. 
             Note that some property pages, after setting this property, 
             will not reflect the new state. However, the filter will use the
             new settings.
